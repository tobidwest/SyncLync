- 🤝 Share collections using a join code
- 📱 Pair your TV using a QR code for easy login
- 📺 Browse and open links on the big screen

## 🚀 Setup
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Provide environment variables (`PORT`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `SESSION_SECRET`, `BASE_URL`).
